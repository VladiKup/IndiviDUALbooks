# IndiviDUALbooks. Proof-of-concept.
MyData IndiviDUALbooks, for under-served people, rescue &amp; learning. It is a 'MyData best practices' dissemination solution.  
When knowledge sources are not accessible (e.g.closed by pandemic; paywalled; marginalized; privacy harming), secure &amp; trusted communication between experts &amp; citizen is paramount: 
with 2clicks-access via #IndiviDUALbook's UpCode/DUAL stickers, on-demand printed, securely, for safe P2P cycling beyond Public Libraries/PL.

Our solution for MASS dissemination combines several sub-systems (1-8), each may function (or not) also autonomously, 
improving life quality
- and their combination enables seamless, human-centric access to the Learning's 'best practices', indiviDUALly: 
- via human senses AND via digital tools/twins of subsystem's products.

Subsystems (1-8):

(1) MyData.org, a non-profit organization, the umbrella, uniting expert communities for ETHICAL human-centric data processing;
takes the responsibility to deliver to global users the experts' choice of a 'best practice', in context of user's data & event.

(2) MyData cooperative (pending form, like a platforms cooperative / PPP), a MyData Case Library/https://mydata.org/cases/ ;
Open Accessible (via PL networks?) for any cooperative member, as a grassroots movement for personal dignity, in hyper-connected world.

(3) PL networks and resources, including the collaborating non-public libraries & knowledge containers, like University libraries etc. (e.g. Finna.fi; Europeana.eu);
enable accumulating of knowledge resources, to be assessed / peer reviewed / suggested to end-user delivery, by sub-systems (1-2).

(4) UpCodeworld.com, http://linker.upcode.net/files/Upcode/Upcode.pdf, THE method to make intelligent solutions to improve processes by handling rich data with AI;
enabling Edge AI processing (never missing user-controlled processor) of Knowledge & Learning data, 
leveraging Smart tags as links for any data with personal rights and values (intrinsic & extrinsic). UpCode coordinates this project.

(5) MyData IndiviDUALbooks / oeBooks (Open Europe books), PL books enriched by products of subsystems (1-4);
for ubiquity and human-centricity of 'best practices' societal penetration & mass dissemination.

(6) ScanTORI, The habit & The method of MIRO (My Interaction with Relevant Objects; like recording of mirror reflections data);
recording at user's memex-like, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex, of interaction between end-user and life quality improving, ethical 'best practice's'tag. This method leverages DHID/DP3T findings (GitHub), but without need of smartphones, i.e. for wider serving under-served groups of population, for 'best practices' (like DHID/DP3T for contact tracing) 60+% of population penetration;
by looking/scanning at the TOp RIght (TORI) corner of physical or virtual objects, mass-placed at what3words.com axes intersections.

(7) what3words.com geo-location grid subsystem, enabling human senses dimension involvement to machine readable geo-data;
enriched by '3rd coordinate' interactions from subsystems (5-6).

(8) Li-Fi, the wireless communication technology which utilizes light to transmit data and position between devices;
enabling co-working of subsystems (1-7), in collaboration and automously.
