MyData IndiviDUALbooks. Proof-of-concept.

PROBLEM

    How to choose & securely connect to the unique user - the best practice / the context-relevant app 
    (e.g. the COVID-19 contact tracing app: from (millions of apps) in app stores); 
    - approved by reliable experts; 
    - how a non-techy user could access the ethical solutions in times of crisis or under stress?
    
SOLUTION. Personal empowerment by TRUST, thanks to mass adoption of the user- & context-relevant INDIVIDUAL best practices,

          via seamless mass dissemination of BENEFICIAL digital habit: 
          - visual & haptic access in1touch of public library book's MyData-button.
     
Tool: MyData IndiviDUALbooks, for rescue & learning under-served people; 'MyData best practices' dissemination service, B2CoOp2C. 
When knowledge sources are not accessible (e.g. closed by pandemic; pay-walled; marginalized; privacy harming),
secure & trusted communication between experts & citizen is paramount. 

Our solution for MASS dissemination & 60+% adoption, combines several sub-systems (1-8), 
which may function (or not) also autonomously, improving life quality

    and their combination enables seamless, human-centric access to the Learning's 'best practices',
    indiviDUALly i.e. via human senses AND via digital twins, tools of subsystem's products.

A physical - with UNIQUE user-related content - oeBook is home delivered in hours 
(with the expert advises, human-readable & machine-readable/by scan at UpCode sticker, integrated into oeBook's dust jacket-envelope),
engaging even digitally illiterate users by human-centric & optimal learning (paper) form factor, 
associated with TRUSTED (PL) experiences,

NB: oeBooks are less costly than via legacy business models of book production & distribution.

IndiviDUALbook/oeBook (Open Europe book), is on-demand SECURELY printed, with AI & Digital Ledger-powered UpCode/DUAL stickers, 
for safe Peer2Peer circular economy closed loop cycling, beyond Public Libraries/PL: without (costly for taxpayer) librarians manual jobs.

Subsystems (1-8):

(1) MyData.org, a non-profit organization, the umbrella, uniting expert communities for ETHICAL human-centric data processing;

takes the responsibility to deliver to global users the experts' choice of a 'best practice', in context of user's data & event.

(2) MyData Global cooperative (a platform cooperative / PPP), a MyData Case Library

https://mydata.org/cases/ ;

Open Accessible (via PL networks / MyData Cooperative Operators, like Digi.me) for any PL network's (thus - the Cooperative) member, as the grassroots movement for personal dignity, in hyper-connected world.

This service's business model is B2CoOp2C /

Business to (MyData) Cooperative Operator to Consumer: Collective framework of service Governance in human-centric way.

An individual may authorize an algorithm to choose MyData Operator’s API by a context 
(via seamless access to a MyData Operator’s API, e.g. by a click at the MyData logo, 
enhanced as-a-button by UpCode, MAI functionality / Mobile Access & Interaction). 
The choice of a user-related context is enabled by backend functionality of oeBook's sticker/interface, 
via UpCode cloud server, leveraging the local library's Database, by linking it to the user reading history, 
via a secure SSI Decentralised IDentities token at oeBook's SMART QR-code/ UpCode.
